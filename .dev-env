Put this into your user clangd config (Project will issue a warning on untrusted server)
clangd from many distros do not support external indexing. 
Use https://github.com/clangd/clangd binaries.
Also use -log=verbose to check for external indexing usage.
vscode can install and manage its own version of clangd.
```yaml
---
If:
  PathMatch: /home/orion/Dev/llvm-project/.*
Index:
  External:
    Server: clangd-index.llvm.org:5900
    MountPoint: /home/orion/Dev/llvm-project
```
[extra]
To view targets use cmake --build ./llvm/out/build/linux-dev/ --target help.
In that way you can cherry pick what to build.
